# Death In Custody Reporting Act

<div style="margin-top: 25px"></div>

The Death In Custody Reporting Act (DICRA) of 2013 requires that some states that receive funding under the Omnibus Crime Contral and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to report to the Attorney General quarterly information regarding the death of any individual under custody of law enforcement officers. This includes individuals who die while incarcerated, en route to incarceration, or during an arrest. 

The reporting quarters are defined as January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December. Reporting deadlines are Jan. 20 (October–December), April 20 (January–March), July 20 (April–June) and October 20 (July–September). You may complete the reporting form at any time during the quarter in which a death occurred. 

The online reporting submission form can be found by [clicking here](https://icjia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cZuWg0gnw2d9NXv). 

Any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the reporting or collection of information regarding deaths in custody should be directed to HDouglas.Otto@Illinois.gov.
